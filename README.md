# Site Structure

Mecca Travels website has 4 pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [guide](guide.html), [gallery](gallery.html) and [sign up](signup.html) are accessable primarily from the navigation menu. There is another page (not on the navigation menu) to let the user know their form has been submitted[signed up](signedup.html).

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
    The fonts chosen were 'Titan One' for the headings and 'Overlock' for the body text. They fall back to Lato and cursive respectively. 
    * "Titan One" was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital relaxed feel, the cursive design gives the user a less intimidating feel over the others.
    * "Overlock" is used for the body text as it provides a nice contrast to the headings being easy on the eyes for the reader.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on White, Black and Gold. The colour blends well with the Kaaba and its surrounding colours in many of the images. White and Black, can give the impression of good and bad like the yin and yang sign for light and dark. The purpose of the journey for the traveller will be for good or bad either to say thanks to Allah(God) or to ask for forgivness.
